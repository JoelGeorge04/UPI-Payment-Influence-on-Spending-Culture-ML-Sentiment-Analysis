iI2NaN_QVTI,@abingeorgy3626,"Hey, Thank you so much for sharing this video ‚Äì it‚Äôs beautifully made, especially relevant to me as someone in the fintech payments industry. I have a few questions related to real-time P2P transfers (e.g., Google Pay, Zelle, UPI with the support of NCPI):

1. Instant Transfers:
We know that P2P transfers, such as those via Google Pay, Benefit, Zelle, and UPI, are deducted from the sender and credited to the receiver almost immediately. Is this real-time transfer also happening from the sender‚Äôs bank to the receiver‚Äôs bank like the back end settlements between the banks?

2. Timing of Transfers:
Suppose, we say ‚Äúreal-time backend settlements,‚Äù what is the actual time frame being referred to?
- Are funds being transferred in true real-time between banks, or is there a delay?

3. Technology Used:
If these transfers are indeed real-time, is blockchain technology involved in UPI or similar systems? 
- If not blockchain, what kind of technology is enabling these rapid transfers?

Comparison with Blockchain:
- If not, how does the technology used in real-time P2P transfers (such as UPI) differ from blockchain technology?

I would appreciate any additional or insights, as I am currently working on a project related to CBDC and would love your input. I‚Äôd also love to engage on a MS team‚Äôs call if needed. Do let me know your thoughts!

iI2NaN_QVTI,@abingeorgy3626,"Hey, Thank you so much for sharing this video ‚Äì it‚Äôs beautifully made, especially relevant to me as someone in the fintech payments industry. I have a few questions related to real-time P2P transfers (e.g., Google Pay, Zelle, UPI with the support of NCPI):

1. Instant Transfers:
We know that P2P transfers, such as those via Google Pay, Benefit, Zelle, and UPI, are deducted from the sender and credited to the receiver almost immediately. Is this real-time transfer also happening from the sender‚Äôs bank to the receiver‚Äôs bank like the back end settlements between the banks?

2. Timing of Transfers:
Suppose, we say ‚Äúreal-time backend settlements,‚Äù what is the actual time frame being referred to?
- Are funds being transferred in true real-time between banks, or is there a delay?

3. Technology Used:
If these transfers are indeed real-time, is blockchain technology involved in UPI or similar systems? 
- If not blockchain, what kind of technology is enabling these rapid transfers?

Comparison with Blockchain:
- If not, how does the technology used in real-time P2P transfers (such as UPI) differ from blockchain technology?

I would appreciate any additional or insights, as I am currently working on a project related to CBDC and would love your input. I‚Äôd also love to engage on a MS team‚Äôs call if needed. Do let me know your thoughts!

Also, there are multiple cases where the Reconcilation / Payment status check in case of stuck cases, happens at NPCI network as the NPCI is the mediator between the banks and Payer and Payee. NPCI also takes care of Autopay i,e the UPI mandate which is also a part of UPI flow...but good work buddy keep it going.
