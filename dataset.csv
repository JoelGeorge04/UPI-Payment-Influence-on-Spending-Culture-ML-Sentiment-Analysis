Once UPI is fully rolled out to foreigners, I'd say put a good chunk of your spending money on UPI so you can carry less cash around and avoid debit and credit card foreign transaction fees.",2023-05-13T06:41:36Z,8297,positive,

iI2NaN_QVTI,@abingeorgy3626,"Hey, Thank you so much for sharing this video – it’s beautifully made, especially relevant to me as someone in the fintech payments industry. I have a few questions related to real-time P2P transfers (e.g., Google Pay, Zelle, UPI with the support of NCPI):

1. Instant Transfers:
We know that P2P transfers, such as those via Google Pay, Benefit, Zelle, and UPI, are deducted from the sender and credited to the receiver almost immediately. Is this real-time transfer also happening from the sender’s bank to the receiver’s bank like the back end settlements between the banks?

2. Timing of Transfers:
Suppose, we say “real-time backend settlements,” what is the actual time frame being referred to?
- Are funds being transferred in true real-time between banks, or is there a delay?

3. Technology Used:
If these transfers are indeed real-time, is blockchain technology involved in UPI or similar systems? 
- If not blockchain, what kind of technology is enabling these rapid transfers?

Comparison with Blockchain:
- If not, how does the technology used in real-time P2P transfers (such as UPI) differ from blockchain technology?

I would appreciate any additional or insights, as I am currently working on a project related to CBDC and would love your input. I’d also love to engage on a MS team’s call if needed. Do let me know your thoughts!

NPCI also takes care of Autopay i,e the UPI mandate which is also a part of UPI flow...but good work buddy keep it going.

Also make sure you don't breach any of the NPCI's policy while sharing the informations on APIs as it could be confidential",2024-11-09T09:15:39Z,311,positive,

iI2NaN_QVTI,@abingeorgy3626,"Hey, Thank you so much for sharing this video – it’s beautifully made, especially relevant to me as someone in the fintech payments industry. I have a few questions related to real-time P2P transfers (e.g., Google Pay, Zelle, UPI with the support of NCPI):

1. Instant Transfers:
We know that P2P transfers, such as those via Google Pay, Benefit, Zelle, and UPI, are deducted from the sender and credited to the receiver almost immediately. Is this real-time transfer also happening from the sender’s bank to the receiver’s bank like the back end settlements between the banks?

2. Timing of Transfers:
Suppose, we say “real-time backend settlements,” what is the actual time frame being referred to?
- Are funds being transferred in true real-time between banks, or is there a delay?

3. Technology Used:
If these transfers are indeed real-time, is blockchain technology involved in UPI or similar systems? 
- If not blockchain, what kind of technology is enabling these rapid transfers?

Comparison with Blockchain:
- If not, how does the technology used in real-time P2P transfers (such as UPI) differ from blockchain technology?

I would appreciate any additional or insights, as I am currently working on a project related to CBDC and would love your input. I’d also love to engage on a MS team’s call if needed. Do let me know your thoughts!
