iI2NaN_QVTI,@AkashPatel-lo7vg,"I don‚Äôt understand why the government should bear the cost of the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) when businesses themselves benefit from offering payment convenience. Currently, businesses that accept credit and debit card payments are charged up to 2.5% by networks like Visa and MasterCard, whereas UPI transactions typically cost less than 1%. If a merchant processes 30 million in transactions, they‚Äôd pay 750,000 in fees for card payments but only 300,000 for UPI, saving 450,000. That‚Äôs a substantial benefit for businesses.

Additionally, if a business only offers cash or card payments, it risks losing customers who prefer UPI due to its ease of use, convenience, and cashback incentives. For instance, imagine a store generating 10 lakhs in monthly revenue with an 8% profit margin, yielding 80,000 in profit. If 10% of customers avoid the store because UPI isn‚Äôt offered, the business loses 1 lakh in revenue, reducing profit by 8,000. However, if UPI were available, the cost for processing UPI transactions would be just 0.5% of 10 lakhs, or 5,000. In this case, the business would still save 3,000 in profit (8,000 saved from avoided customer loss, minus the 5,000 UPI fee).

This example shows that not offering UPI can result in lost revenue and profits, while adopting it saves money and retains customers. Businesses are ultimately responsible for covering the costs associated with providing convenient payment methods, as they directly benefit from increased sales and customer satisfaction. Expecting the government to cover MDR is unnecessary when merchants stand to gain both loyalty and higher profits by embracing UPI, a more cost-effective payment solution.",2025-03-21T19:30:21Z,0,neutral

iI2NaN_QVTI,@abingeorgy3626,"Hey, Thank you so much for sharing this video ‚Äì it‚Äôs beautifully made, especially relevant to me as someone in the fintech payments industry. I have a few questions related to real-time P2P transfers (e.g., Google Pay, Zelle, UPI with the support of NCPI):

1. Instant Transfers:
We know that P2P transfers, such as those via Google Pay, Benefit, Zelle, and UPI, are deducted from the sender and credited to the receiver almost immediately. Is this real-time transfer also happening from the sender‚Äôs bank to the receiver‚Äôs bank like the back end settlements between the banks?

2. Timing of Transfers:
Suppose, we say ‚Äúreal-time backend settlements,‚Äù what is the actual time frame being referred to?
- Are funds being transferred in true real-time between banks, or is there a delay?

3. Technology Used:
If these transfers are indeed real-time, is blockchain technology involved in UPI or similar systems? 
- If not blockchain, what kind of technology is enabling these rapid transfers?

Comparison with Blockchain:
- If not, how does the technology used in real-time P2P transfers (such as UPI) differ from blockchain technology?

I would appreciate any additional or insights, as I am currently working on a project related to CBDC and would love your input. I‚Äôd also love to engage on a MS team‚Äôs call if needed. Do let me know your thoughts!
